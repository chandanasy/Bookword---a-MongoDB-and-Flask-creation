# Bookword---a-MongoDB-and-Flask-creation
This project utilizes MongoDB, Flask, and HTML to create a user-friendly web page that displays information about authors and their books.

To begin, we imported data from an extensive dataset containing information about authors using Jupyter Notebook. This data was then stored in MongoDB for efficient querying and manipulation.

In addition to the imported data, we integrated the OpenLibrary API to supplement biographical and book information for three specific authors - JK Rowling, Stephen King, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. This information was added to their respective documents in the MongoDB collection, providing a more comprehensive view of their work.

To display the data, we created a web page using Flask and HTML. The user-friendly format includes author information and links to their books on Amazon, making it easy for users to explore their favorite authors and discover new ones.

Overall, Bookworm provides a simple and efficient way to explore information about authors and their books using MongoDB and Flask.
